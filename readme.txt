This is a summary on the physics I have learned during my study in college.
The summary is very brief and a lot of details have been eliminated, since it is mainly a mnemonic notes for myself.
The reference of my summary includes a lof of classical textbooks as well as wikipedia.
Thanks to all the men who devoted themselves in dicovering the laws of our universe as well as those who deliverd these delicate knowledge in a clear and interesting way, I can have a chance to look in the beauty of our nature.
